					I have been programming since I was 8 starting with small batch programs. I spent hours in batch playing with these batch
					programs, Googling around and finding source code to paste together small games, Ones that would ask questions, and would
					very the output based on the users input. I also worked on small things like making little batch programs that were just
					"Ease of Life" by completing small tasks for me. As of December of 2016, I started to take on the project of learning C++
					as fully As I possibly could. Spending the time to learn C++ and incorporate and improve Upon my reverse engineering skills.

					From all the time I was doing assembly level debugging, I have learned quite a bit about debugging applications. And from
					my Vocational Tech class I helped the class when it came to debugging and fixing errors in students applications.

					I spend some of my free time playing in Photoshop and Cinema 4D, While I am no professional I have some skills that allow
					me to do what I am looking for in these programs. I spent more time in Photoshop just creates effects which came out quite
					nicely for what I wanted.

				<div class="content">
					The thing I love doing most is breaking things, And hopefully putting them back together. I spend a lot of time looking
					into programs in IDA, ReClass, WinDBG, and Cheat Engine. Assembly is one of my favorite, but most inexperienced programming
					languages. If there is one thing I would love to learn more of and I started to do whenever I can, Is reverse engineering.
					I am not the best at it, but I have done some work that gives me quite a bit of experience working in environments such as
					IDA. Where I learned quite a bit about how computers work. Such as memory addresses, pointers, How hexadecimal relates to
					assembly and how assembly relates to the programming language.
