					<p>
						This is a course I took in high school in the 11th grade, this is a class that teaches not only Javascript programming as
						well as game programming in Game Make Studio 2, This class also taught me a lot of good resources like Agile software development
						and how to work better as a team. This class was a good leanring experiance as I knew a lot of programming already but not
						a lot of class for say was programming. A lot of it also taught me what to do in a software development enviroment.

					<p>
						I had an 2 day internship at GE with a few people from my Principals of Computing class, in this internship we learned a
						lot about how GE works and how they do software development. Later into the internship we spent time with ardinos learning
						to program them and later we had a group. In our groups we split our resources and made an idea as one way we could
						"Help the enviroment" with our ideas and develop and deploy it. Our group did energy conservation with an arduino that
						auto detected the light value outside and changed the lighting indoors to match a good light value to save on resources.
						In the process we used agile software development methods to do this and it helped me wrap my head around Agile and
						working as a team.
