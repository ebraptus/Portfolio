					<p>
						I have used windows 7 - 10 for most of my development days, working with it as my daily driver on my desktop computer. I

						<div class="bar" data-percent="90"></div>
					</div>
					<p>
						Visual studio is my main IDE when working in C++ or any other language that Visual Studio supports. I have tried other IDEs
						but Visual Studio has always had the best toolset and style for me. I have been working in visual studio for years and
						I have mostly gotten used to all of the program, and all of its features. There are a few exclusions to this such as
						I do not completly know the toolset for profiling and debugging programs but I know it enough to get what I need done.

				<div class="title">VSCode</div>
				<div class="content">
					<div class="progress">
						<div class="bar" data-percent="80"></div>
					</div>
					<p>
						I use VSCode for most of my web development. I love this IDE for how lightweight and customizable it is. I have used a lot
						of IDE's and this is hand down my favorite for web development.

				<div class="title">VI/VIM</div>
				<div class="content">
					<div class="progress">
						<div class="bar" data-percent="40"></div>
					</div>
					<p>
						I have recently started using vim as of June 2017, this is quickly becoming one of my new favorite text editors/IDEs. Learning
						the toolset is quite difficult but is very intuitive and I am learning tp use them to my advantage one step at a time.
						I would say I know enough about this editor to be proficient, But not enough to get as much work done as I could in
						something like atom or sublime. But I am learning more every time I use the program and slowly becoming better.

					</div>
					<p>
						I have been working in photoshop for a few years on and off whenever I needed it. I took a visual design class focused around
						photoshop, but I knew everything in the class already. I can get done what I need, but not without the help of google
						and some time learning new tools now and then. But I am all around proficient in the program as a whole.
