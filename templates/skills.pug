                    p I have been programming since I was 8 starting with small batch programs. I spent hours in batch playing with these batch programs, Googling around and finding source code to paste together small games, Ones that would ask questions, and would very the output based on the users input. I also worked on small things like making little batch programs that were just "Ease of Life" by completing small tasks for me. As of December of 2016, I started to take on the project of learning C++ as fully As I possibly could. Spending the time to learn C++ and incorporate and improve Upon my reverse engineering skills.

                    p I have played with Ardunios to make small projects and have learned a lot of Arduino programming from my own personal projects such as my personal 3D printer and programming it. And learning it to make small projects in my Game Programming & Design classes, where we made small robots with Ardinos.

                    p From all the time I was doing assembly level debugging, I have learned quite a bit about debugging applications. And from my Vocational Tech class I helped the class when it came to debugging and fixing errors in students applications.

                .card-content
                    p I have doen some circuitry for some home projects and for a lot of my VoTech projects. I rewired a 3D printer on my own with a custom motherboard for one of my more major projects. With a lot of small projects in my VoTech class. I have a pretty good understanding of Electrical Engineering. I love playing with circuitry and learning more and more every day. This includes soldering and breadboarding, I have worked with both mostly breadboarding and then soldering it to a blank PCB.

                .card-content
                    p I took on this passion in my senior year high school game programming class. We had a Da Vinci Duo 2.0 and a FlashForge Creator Pro. Two pretty decent 3D printers. I had seen them online and I saw a few people use them for small projects but I never really thought about using them. But once I did I couldn't stop. It became such a fun little side project and had so many opportunities I loved doing it and finding new things to do. 3D printing really did just turn into another tool in my belt for the future projects that were to come.

                    p I have used Agile in my Vocational Tech class, we used it when working on projects to help us get our work done and make sure when we worked together that we got everythign we needed done and in a time effective way.

                    p I spend some of my free time playing in Photoshop and Cinema 4D, While I am no professional I have some skills that allow me to do what I am looking for in these programs. I spent more time in Photoshop just creates effects which came out quite nicely for what I wanted.

                .card-content
                    p The thing I love doing most is breaking things, And hopefully putting them back together. I spend a lot of time looking into programs in IDA, ReClass, WinDBG, and Cheat Engine. Assembly is one of my favorite, but most inexperienced programming languages. If there is one thing I would love to learn more of and I started to do whenever I can, Is reverse engineering. I am not the best at it, but I have done some work that gives me quite a bit of experience working in environments such as IDA. Where I learned quite a bit about how computers work. Such as memory addresses, pointers, How hexadecimal relates to assembly and how assembly relates to the programming language.
