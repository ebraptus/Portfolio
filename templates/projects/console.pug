                    h3 Description
                    p This project was just a simple project application, taking in arguments to make a command line interface to do simple actions and return certain results. This console app just included a help menu with a option to clear the console window, show all commands, and a rubiks cube scramble generator that I made just for the fun of it.

                        li Input parameters given to programs to run it differently depending on what given
