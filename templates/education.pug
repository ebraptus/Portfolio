                        | as well as game programming in Game Make Studio 2, This class also taught me a lot of good resources like Agile
                        | software development and how to work better as a team. This class was a good learning experience as I knew a lot of
                        | programming already but not a lot of class for say was programming. A lot of it also taught me what to do in a software
                        | development environment.

                        | This is a course I took in high school in the 12th grade, this class taught me so much and really was a huge stepping
                        | stone, not into programming but getting into a programming job and learning how to work as a team. I had done so much
                        | programming in the past that I didn't really have anything to learn in class about that. But I did learn to help others
                        | learn how to start programming and that's what I tried to do. I spent a lot of time teaching better code practices to
                        | fellow classmates and friends. This is the year that I and 5 other friends started Your8BitGame.com and we had our
                        | teacher as a major help in this and gave us the idea and helped us get started. This was an amazing tribute to our
                        | teamwork and helped us get into agile based programming.

                        | I had an 2 day internship at GE with a few people from my Principals of Computing class, in this internship we learned
                        | a lot about how GE works and how they do software development. Later into the internship, we spent time with Arduino
                        | learning to program them and later we had a group. In our groups, we split our resources and made an idea as one way we
                        | could "Help the environment" with our ideas and develop and deploy it. Our group did energy conservation with an
                        | Arduino that auto detected the light value outside and changed the lighting indoors to match a good light value to save
                        | on resources. In the process we used agile software development methods to do this and it helped me wrap my head around
                        | Agile and working as a team.
