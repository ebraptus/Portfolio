                    | C++ is my favorite programming language currently. I have learned since December of 2016, Where I first started with C++
                    | Primer 5th edition by Stanley B Lippman. But books are the best way for me to learn. I did most of my
                    | learning by trial and error, Google, MSDN, and studying other people's source code. I would say I have
                    | a decent mastery of the programming language, but I still have a lot of learning to do. The only parts
                    | of C++ that I know are the parts I use. So of course there is still a lot of learning to be done. I have
                    | plenty more learning to do though, and I am always extensively reaching out to learn this language as
                    | much as possible.

                    | language I know almost everything there could be to know, There is of course still stuff I do not know
                    | as it is stuff I do not know as I have not ever needed it so I have not spent the time to learn it.

                    | this alongside with flask for better fullstackd development and from my experiance I have gained pretty
                    | good knowledge of how the languge is structured and from this better CSS code

                    | I learned CSS with HTML as they are mostly needed for each other, I have not gone into great lengths so learn CSS as it is
                    | a very self explanatory language. And there is not much to know about CSS and with all the libraries
                    | available online. I have spent a long time using it so I understand the structure and most of the selectors
                    | and how they work, with my experiance if there is any problem I can fix it with just a litle research

                    | I have ever really taken an interest in. As it is a very basic language you can not exactly do what I
                    | like doing in JavaScript so I have kept my learning to web development with it. I did take a course in
                    | my Sophomore year of High School on this, With learning it in TouchDevelop, But I had already known all
                    | that I was learning in the class as it was for people who had never programmed before. I would say I
                    | have a moderate knowledge of the language and I know the ins and outs of the syntax, but I do not know
                    | much about actually using the language with things such as Libraries, But with a small amount of googling
                    | and time I would be able to make just about anything.

                    | I have spent a small time using PHP, I only used it to create login forms for my website using MySQL with it. A very basically
                    | knowledge of the language, but I know the syntax of the language quite well. And with a small amount
                    | of goggling and time I am able to learn the language quite easily.

                    | But I never went into depths with this language and I know some of the syntax but not a lot. Another
                    | one of my favorite languages as it is so versatile and useful, but I have not had a lot of experience
                    | actually using it to actually learn it.

                    | being able to add information in and helps with my PHP replacement.

                    | Django is the language I used to replace flash in my portfolio. I had used flash for a while but I saw django as the future library for web development as it had a lot more features and seemed to be more widly accepted as the superior library for back end for websites while flash seemed to have better support for flash. In the end Django is the back end I prefer to use though.
